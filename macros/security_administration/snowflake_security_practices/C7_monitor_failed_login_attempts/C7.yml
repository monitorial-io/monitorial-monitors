    description: "The following approach returns results based on either the FAILED_LOGINS count or the
        log in failure rate (AVERAGE_SECONDS_BETWEEN_LOGIN_ATTEMPTS). This approach helps
        distinguish a brute force attack from a human who is struggling to remember their password.
        There are inline comments on how to adjust the query to limit results"
